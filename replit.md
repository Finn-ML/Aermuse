# Aermuse Artist Management Platform

## Overview

Aermuse is an artist management platform designed to empower independent musicians with professional tools for contract management, fan engagement, and online presence. The platform combines AI-powered contract analysis with customizable landing pages and fan relationship management, providing artists with comprehensive control over their careers.

The application is built as a full-stack TypeScript project with a React frontend and Express backend, featuring a modern UI design inspired by sophisticated creative platforms with a distinctive burgundy and cream color scheme.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server, providing fast HMR and optimized production builds
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing instead of React Router
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and data synchronization

**UI Component System**
- Radix UI primitives for accessible, unstyled component foundations
- shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI with custom styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with extensive customization
- Custom design system with burgundy (#660033) and cream (#F7E6CA) color palette
- Nunito font family with weights from 200-800 for typography hierarchy

**Visual Effects**
- Three.js for WebGL shader animations on landing and auth pages
- Custom grain overlay component for texture effects
- CSS custom properties for theme management and component variants

**State Management**
- React Context API for authentication state
- TanStack Query for server state with optimistic updates
- Local component state with useState/useEffect hooks
- Form state managed through react-hook-form with Zod validation

**Routing Strategy**
- Client-side routing with Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- Main routes: Landing (/), Auth (/auth), Dashboard (/dashboard)
- Fallback to index.html for SPA behavior

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js for HTTP server and middleware pipeline
- Node.js HTTP server for WebSocket support capability
- Session-based authentication using express-session
- MemoryStore for session storage (suitable for development, would need Redis/PostgreSQL for production scaling)

**API Design**
- RESTful API endpoints organized by resource type
- Session-based authentication with httpOnly cookies
- Simple password hashing with SHA-256 (production should use bcrypt)
- CRUD operations for users, contracts, landing pages, and links

**Request Handling**
- JSON body parsing with raw body access for webhook verification
- URL-encoded form data support
- Static file serving from dist/public directory
- SPA fallback routing for client-side navigation

**Security Considerations**
- Session secret configuration (defaults for development)
- Secure cookies in production environment
- CORS and rate limiting dependencies available but not yet implemented
- Input validation using Zod schemas

### Data Storage

**Database**
- PostgreSQL as the primary relational database
- Neon serverless PostgreSQL for cloud-hosted database with WebSocket support
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript type inference

**Schema Design**
- Users table: authentication credentials, profile data, plan tier
- Contracts table: document metadata, AI analysis results, status tracking
- Landing Pages table: customizable artist pages with slug-based URLs
- Landing Page Links table: social links and external resources
- UUID primary keys generated by PostgreSQL
- JSON/JSONB columns for flexible data (social links, AI analysis)
- Timestamp tracking for created_at and updated_at

**Data Access Layer**
- IStorage interface defining all data operations
- DatabaseStorage implementation using Drizzle ORM
- Repository pattern separating database logic from business logic
- Type-safe queries with schema validation using drizzle-zod

### External Dependencies

**Database Services**
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL with WebSocket support for edge deployments
- Connection pooling via @neondatabase/serverless

**UI Component Libraries**
- Radix UI: Accessible component primitives (@radix-ui/* packages)
- shadcn/ui: Pre-built components with Tailwind styling
- cmdk: Command palette component
- vaul: Drawer component library

**Development & Build Tools**
- Vite: Frontend build tool and dev server
- esbuild: Server bundling for production
- TypeScript: Type checking across frontend, backend, and shared code
- Drizzle Kit: Database migration management

**Utility Libraries**
- Zod: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- date-fns: Date manipulation and formatting
- nanoid: Unique ID generation
- class-variance-authority: Component variant management
- clsx & tailwind-merge: Conditional CSS class handling

**Authentication & Session Management**
- express-session: Session middleware
- connect-pg-simple: PostgreSQL session store (available but using MemoryStore)
- memorystore: In-memory session storage for development

**Planned Integrations** (dependencies present but not yet implemented)
- Stripe: Payment processing for premium plans
- OpenAI/Google Generative AI: Contract analysis and AI features
- Nodemailer: Email notifications
- Multer: File upload handling for contracts
- WebSocket (ws): Real-time features
